# Rustproof

[Rustproof github repo](https://github.com/redsuperbat/rustproof)

Spelling is hard, especially when you're writing text all day long and the value you provide isn't measured by the conciseness of your code but rather its correctness.

For a developer, spelling is just the icing on the cake. A developer who can write good code with clear intent, as well as avoid spelling mistakes, makes my brain explode.

Since my code always conveys proper intent üíÅ and I was struggling with the spelling part, I decided to use a spellchecker for my code. This gave me the extra edge I needed to excel.

I started by using cspell, a fairly popular spellchecker that uses LSP to communicate spelling errors to my editor. It worked fine for most files, but it sometimes became unhinged when files were over 1000 lines, with the CPU hitting 100% and memory usage skyrocketing.

At some point, I had to add a file size check to my LSP config in Neovim to explicitly prevent cspell from running on large files. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Adding additional languages was also a pain. I'm Swedish and maintain some websites with Swedish copy, which was unknowingly littered with spelling errors reported by cspell. I tried adding the Swedish cspell dictionary, but after an hour of searching and trial and error, I gave up and opted to disable cspell LSP in projects with Swedish copy.

After some time, I stumbled upon harper-ls, a fantastic project I thought would solve all my problems. However, it fell short since it could only spellcheck comments and markdown‚Äîessentially addressing a different need than what cspell was doing.

Therefore, I decided to create my own code spellchecker, and rustproof was born.

Rustproof has a simple architecture very common to how cspell works but leverages [hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io) in order to spellcheck words. This allows Rustproof to load dictionaries from any language supported by hunspell. Below you can see a demonstration of the LSP in action:
