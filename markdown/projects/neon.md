# Neon programming language

A compact, expression-based language built in Rust ðŸ¦€

This language offers a concise yet powerful feature set:

- Expression-based syntax
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, modulus)
- Control flow structures (if, else, else if)
- Support for recursion

Feel free to try it out in the playground ðŸ‘‡
